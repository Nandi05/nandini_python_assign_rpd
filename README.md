# nandini_python_assign_rpd
internship task
This is the task which was given for the selection process.
All the tasks are completed with headings in the .ipynb file. I used  jupyter notebook for the whole task.
The last task which was to save the processed_data.csv file in the mysql database with password was completed through the command line and screenshots of the same have been attached with the repository.
